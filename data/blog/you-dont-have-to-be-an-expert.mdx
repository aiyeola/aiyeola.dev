## Theme context in Material-UI

You can find all code for this blog post in the Github repository of this blog's implementation.
The following snippets are taken from _src/theme/ThemeProvider.tsx_.

Material-UI already brings a provider for accessing the current theme with it out of the box:

```typescript
<MuiThemeProvider theme={selectedTheme.appliedTheme}>
  <CssBaseline />
  {children}
</MuiThemeProvider>
```
