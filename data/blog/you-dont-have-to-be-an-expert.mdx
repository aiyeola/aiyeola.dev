You don’t have to be an expert; you just have to be **confident in your ability** to figure things out 😎. Being good at what you do is not a function of how long you’ve been on the job or in the field but a function of your exposure to ‘use cases’ in that field. With software development and any discipline in general, there’s a learning curve to become an expert or professional. It is said that it takes 10,000 hours of active engagement in a field to become an expert. I’d rather not believe I have to code for hours to become a pro developer 😄. The validation of your work is what makes you pro not the hours involved!

If not anything, one thing needed for sure to become a pro developer is the ability to learn and unlearn, even after sticking to one language, one framework, there are still set of tools or techniques that resolves an issue in different ways, be it a feature you want to implement or an idea still going through the brooding process, your level of exposure to that use case is what navigates you through that problem. I remember first time I needed to connect to an SQL database in NodeJS, because I had been exposed to connecting to a NoSQL database(MongoDB) with both the native driver and ODM(Mongoose), I knew that those might also be available with SQL databases, found out that SQL databases have their own native drivers and interestingly there are ORM’s too (typeorm, sequelize, prisma) that connect to almost all SQL databases. That was mind blowing. Having discovered that, I asked why an ORM was created since they’re native drivers for each DB, that’s when I was exposed to the subject of clean architecture, how parts of your app should best be built decoupled from other aspects, that in turned exposed me to another topic ‘microservices’. It goes on and on.

Understanding uses cases will help you become a better developer. Another instance was in mid-2020, I got into an internship program, I had coding experience (binged tutorial videos 😁) but I built nothing. We were to build a real-world use case app, and that was it. I joined the backend team and in 3 months, we built the API for a company(fictional) that manages global travel for its workforce, that experience alone boosted my confidence and put me on the path to become a pro at what I do.

Benjamin Barber once said “I don’t divide the world into the weak and the strong, or the successes
and the failures... I divide the world into the learners and non-learners.”

Keep learning, keep building! May the force be with you 🚀
