"Happiness comes from **what** we do. Fulfillment comes from **why** we do." - Simon Sinek.

When I tell people that knew me before writing one line of code that I'm now a software developer, a lot of them are surprised at that fact. Also, since I studied chemical engineering in university, most ask how I made that transition and all the time I would smile 😊 at their reactions. This article will shed insight into why I'm in software development.

Much like everyone I hope to change the world in any way I can, to be and do more for my family, society, and humanity at large. Be it to better the justice system, contribute to making a sustainable economy, or becoming the next big thing. Everyone shares these aspirations, but we all know there's a limit to the spheres of life one individual can have an impact upon. That's why one must have a vision, one must have focus, one must have a reason.
