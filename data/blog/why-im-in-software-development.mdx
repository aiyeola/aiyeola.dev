When I tell people that knew me prior to writing one line of code that I'm now a software developer, a lot of them are suprised at that fact. Also, owing to the fact that I studied chemical engineering in university, most ask how I made that transition and all the time I would smile üòä. This article will shed insight into why I'm in software developement.

Much like everyone I hope to change the world in anyway I can, to be and do more for my family, society and humanity at large. Be it to better the justice system, contribute to making a sustainable economy, or being the next big thing. Everyone shares these aspirations, but we all know there's a limit to the spheres of life an individual can have impact upon (when you're not Jesus üëë). People are reckoned for their contributions to a specific niche. When you hear the name 'Greta Thunberg' what comes to mind - 'environmental activist', when you hear these names: 'Jeff Bezos', 'Elon Musk', 'Mark Zukerberg', 'Shola Akinlade', you know what sphere they influence. That is it. To create value, fight/stand for something, building products, living a happy life and changing the world - The core of every human desire.

Growing up, I've always been fascinated by tech, all the challenges it solves and is still solving, the opportunities it presents to the mordern world, and it's transformational power to disrupt businesses, individual lifestyle and industries. Discovering that I can contribute to this ecosystem and leverage tools in tech to add value blew my mind, it was like someone just told me that I now have a superpower ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. 

**To contribute to the tech space by creating tools that add value** - That's why I'm in software developement.
