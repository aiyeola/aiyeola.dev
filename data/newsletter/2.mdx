Hi guys 👋, 

Today makes it a week and a day I launched [aiyeola.dev](https://aiyeola.dev?ref=newsletter_mail). I'm glad you guys subscribed. I hope you find my space interesting sooner or later 😏.

The feedback from the community on launch day and after was massive, I'm most grateful and happy those insights were provided.

So, I'm taking to action on the feedback given. Here is a list of the features & ideas I intend to implement

* A portfolio section
* Add Google Auth to Guestbook
* Review blog posts
* Persist theme state on refresh
* Make the product a PWA (progressive web app)
* User engagement feature - Comments basically

Those are what I'll be focusing on. 
The project is open to contributions, if you intend to contribute kindly make a PR to [the repo](https://github.com/aiyeola/aiyeola.dev).

Thanks for reading! Have a great day :)
